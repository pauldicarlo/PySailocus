#### Background
Sailocus is an attempt to write code that will explore the aerodynamic forces on sails.  It is meant to be a development exercise to build my proficiency in some new programming languages... as well as better understand forces on sails... and maybe even design my own sails someday.

#### The Name Sailocus
The name Sailocus comes from "sail" and "locus" (see quote above).


## About
PySailocus is a project for Python/Tkinter development.  Tkinter was chosen because it usually comes already with Python.  The application is a currently a PROTOTYPE right now, where it will calculate the center of effort for a single sail (being 3 or 4 sided).  As time progresses (and my knowledge of sails) the application will be flushed out to make it more robust.  

### Caveat
You should only use sails designed and made by a professional.  This code is just for a learning excercise.
